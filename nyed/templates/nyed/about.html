    <h3>Who built this website?</h3>
    <p>This website is developed and maintained by <i>Sourfig</i>, a high school senior who loves to explore technology and data.</p>

    <h3>What inspired you to build this website?</h3>
    <p>As we all know, the COVID pandemic has severely impacted students’ learning across all grade levels. When the NYS Education Department (NYSED) announced
    in spring 2021 that most of high school Regents exams would be cancelled and students of all grade levels would be allowed to opt out of the State's annual
    academic assessment tests again, similar to the cancellation and exemption policy as in 2020, it prompted me
    to ask the question: how would NYSED be able to evaluate the pandemic impact on students’ learning without adequate assessment results?
    How has NYSED been measuring and tracking students’ academic progress in order to provide support and intervention to schools prior to the pandemic?
    </p>
    <p>While researching the NYSED website to seek answers, I discovered that NYSED has recently created
    a new website called <a href="http://data.nysed.gov">“Data Dashboard”</a> (http://data.nysed.gov) which aims to provide the public with transparency
    to schools’ essential data, such as G3-G8 ELA/Math assessment test results, demographics, average class size, teachers' qualifications, etc.  While the website
    does supply valuable education information and data, I noticed some issues in the way certain data are presented:
    <br><br>
    1.  The NYSED website says that the assessment data is meant to “reflect students’ progress toward college and career readiness”. However,
    its presentation model only displays data of the most recent two consecutive years to illustrate students’ academic progress. This model
    not only is inadequate for showing students’ progress from lower to high grade levels, but also appears obsecure to viewers. For example, looking at 
    the following screenshot photo taken from the NYSED website, which is supposedly meant
    to show the ELA assessment test data of Grade 3 students at South Salem Elementary School, can you quickly tell what information this bar graph
    is trying to convey to us?
    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    2.  Some parts of the data presentation model seem to exhibit misleading information because the model uses
    students' assessment data from two different years but of the same grade level for comparison. For example, the screenshot photo taken from the NYSED website below
    shows that among the Grade 3 students at South Salem Elementary School, 66% of them were proficient at ELA in 2018 while 71% of them
    were proficient at ELA in 2019.  If the viewers only paid attention to the percentage increase from 2018 to 2019, they would have concluded that
    Grade 3 students at Salem Elementary School had shown good improvement in ELA.  However, this conclusion is incorrect
    because Grade 3 of class 2018 is a completely different cohort of children from Grade 3 of class 2019. Therefore, their performances
    are incomparable and do not indicate any academic improvement or regression.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    <p>After discovering these issues, I asked myself if I could design a better data visualization model to accurately capture and illustrate
    the multi-year academic performances of a student cohort as the students progress from elementary to middle school.</p>

    <p>In addition, I noticed significant gaps in students' ELA and Math proficiencies across different school districts. 
    I was curious: what could have caused such disparity? Is there any correlation between students’ academic performance and external
    factors that might affect their performance, such as schools' average class size, student families' financial status, etc?
    </p>
    <p>With these questions in mind, I decided to combine my knowledge acquired from Statistics class and my interest in data analytics and computer programming
    to conduct my own research.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the objective of this website?</h3>
    <p>The objectives of my research project are:
    <ul>
    <li>To provide parents and educators insights into New York State's education system by:<br><br>
    a) creating a data visualization model that accurately illustrates the academic performance of a student cohort
    from Grade 3 to Grade 8 so that parents and educators can easily visualize the students’ progress and evaulate school’s performance.
    <br><br>
    b) developing a data analysis model to investigate if there’s any correlation between students’ academic performance and
    external factors that might have affected their performance, such as schools' average class size, student families' financial status.
    <br><br></li>
    <li>To share ideas and findings with fellow data science/information science/computing technology enthusiasts.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Where did you get your datasets?</h3>
    <p>NYSED provides free datasets from year 1999 to present at <a href="https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php">https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php</a>.
    Many thanks to NYSED for providing such valuable data.</p>

    <h3>What programming languages and tools did you use to build this website?</h3>
    <p>Python (Django, matplotlib, etc.), MySQL, Javascript, HTML & CSS</p>

    <h3>What are the challenges you encountered while developing this site?</h3>
    <p>There were many challenges I encountered during this project. In addition to applying the basic programming skills
    I acquired from AP Computer Science courses, I had to do a lot of self-learning to pick up new knowledge and skills as
    I worked on each component of this project.  The most challenging parts of the project are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Converting datasets to MySQL:</b> the original datasets provided by NYSED are in MS Access or Excel files. I had to convert and inject them into MySQL
    for my programs to process. Although my computer has Windows 10 and MS Access installed, I had trouble exporting the data from MS Access to MySQL directly.
    Eventually I figured out to use MS SQL Server as an intermediary database, which means I had export the data from MS Access to SQL Server first, then export
    them again from SQL Server to MySQL.
    </li>
    <li><b>Handling data quality issues:</b> NYSED provides about 20 years worth of datasets. The datasets prior to 2013 are stored in different data schedma from
    those of the more recent years. Even among the recent-year datasets, the schemas are not consistent; some data are incorrect (e.g. a column that is supposed to contain
    percentage values may have values >100). Therefore, I had to examine and compare each set of data and schema carefully. I often had to write SQL code to filter,
    or correct the erroneous data. It was a time-consuming task.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What other websites would you recommend to people who are also interested in data science or data analytics?</h3>
    <p>While working on this project, I discovered that many U.S. government websites now provide free historical datasets.
    Here is a list of websites I find very helpful:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://data.ny.gov/">New York State Open Data Project</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">New York City Open Data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google's Data Search Site </a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.kaggle.com">www.kaggle.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.towardsdatascience.com">Towards Data Science.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets">Github Awesome Datasets</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this website's URL "sourfig.pythonanywhere.com"?</h3>
    <p>Thanks to www.pythonanywhere.com company, I'm currently using a <i>free</i> account offered by pythonanywhere.com to host this website. "Sourfig" is the account name.</p>

    <h3>Why doesn't this website provide data prior to year 2012?</h3>
    <p>In order to host this website, the data must be stored in a database provided by the web hosting company www.pythonanywhere.com.
    Since I'm using its free hosting service, the data storage space is very limited as per pythonanywhere.com's service plan. Even though NYSED provides data before year 2012,
    I cannot fit all of them into the database. I decided to use the most recent years of data for this project and tried to fit as much data as permitted.
    </p>

    <h3>What does "Sourfig" mean?</h3>
    <p>You gussed it - fig is one of my favorite fruits. Although I prefer sweet figs, I think "sourfig" is easier to spell and enunciate. Just like each fig harvested from a fig tree
    carrying a slightly different color, shape, and flavor, every piece of data embodies a unique story to tell. And it's up to us to uncover its story.
